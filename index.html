 <p> dream in AI is to build something powerful that comes from the pain <br> of heartbreak. My goal is to turn my personal loss into hope<br> and healing through technology. My passion is to create solutions<br> that understand emotions and offer real help to people who feel forgotten.<br> My vision is to support those I call <sub> <mark>BIG X</mark> </sub> who are silently struggling like I once did.<br> My purpose is not just to invent, but to make a real difference in the lives of those who need it most. </p>
